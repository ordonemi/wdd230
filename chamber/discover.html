                <h2>What Makes Us Stand Out?</h2>
                <p>1. Business-Friendly Environment<br>Houston prides itself on being one of the most business-friendly cities in the United States. It has no state or local income tax, which makes it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and corporations.</p>
                <p>2. Energy Hub<br>Houston is often referred to as the "Energy Capital of the World." It hosts the headquarters of numerous energy giants and is a global leader in energy research, production, and distribution.</p>
                <p>3. Quality of Life<br>Houston offers an exceptional quality of life with a low cost of living, excellent healthcare facilities, world-class cultural institutions, and a diverse culinary scene. Its warm climate, affordable housing, and rich cultural experiences make it an appealing destination for both employees and business owners.</p>
                <p>4. Talented Workforce<br>Houston is home to a highly educated and diverse workforce. With over 60 colleges and universities in the Greater Houston area, businesses can tap into a pool of skilled professionals across various fields.</p>
                <p>5. Infrastructure and Connectivity<br>Houston boasts a well-developed infrastructure with extensive road networks, a major international airport, and a growing public transportation system. Its strategic location enables businesses to efficiently reach customers, suppliers, and partners, both domestically and globally.</p>
